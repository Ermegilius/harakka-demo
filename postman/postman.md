# Postman Collection

## Harakka API Collection

The `Harakka.json` file contains our complete Postman collection with all API endpoints for the Harakka Storage & Booking Application.

### What's Included

- **All API endpoints** - Complete coverage of backend routes
- **Request examples** - Sample requests for each endpoint
- **Response examples** - Expected response structures

### What's NOT Included

⚠️ **Environment variables are not included in this collection.** You'll need to set up your own Postman environment with the following variables:

- Base URL (e.g., `http://localhost:3000` or your deployment URL)
- Authentication tokens
- Any other environment-specific values

### How to Use

1. Import `Harakka.json` into Postman
2. Create a new environment in Postman
3. Configure your environment variables (API URL, tokens, etc.)
4. Start making requests!

### Keeping It Updated

When adding or modifying API endpoints, remember to export and update the `Harakka.json` collection file.
