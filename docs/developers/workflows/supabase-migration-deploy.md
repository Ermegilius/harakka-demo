# Supabase Migration Deployment Workflow

This document describes the automated GitHub Actions workflow that deploys Supabase database migrations to production when PRs are merged into the `develop` branch.

## Overview

The `supabase-migration-deploy.yml` workflow automatically:

1. **Triggers only on completed merges** to the `develop` branch
2. **Detects migration changes** by comparing files in `supabase/migrations/`
3. **Validates migrations** before deploying to production
4. **Deploys migrations safely** using Supabase CLI
5. **Provides comprehensive logging** and error handling

## Workflow Triggers

### Automatic Triggers

- **Push to develop branch**: Only when files in `supabase/migrations/` have changed
- **Merge detection**: Only runs on actual PR merges (not direct pushes)

### Manual Triggers

- **Workflow dispatch**: Can be manually triggered from GitHub Actions UI

## Prerequisites

### Required GitHub Secrets

The workflow requires these secrets to be configured in your repository settings:

| Secret Name | Description | Example |
|-------------|-------------|---------|
| `SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN` | Supabase CLI access token | `sbp_abc123...` |
| `PRODUCTION_PROJECT_ID` | Production Supabase project reference | `abcdefghijklmnop` |
| `PRODUCTION_DB_PASSWORD` | Production database password | `your_secure_password` |

### Setting Up Secrets

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Navigate to **Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions**
3. Click **New repository secret** for each required secret
4. Add the values from your Supabase production project

## How It Works

### 1. Smart Triggering

```yaml
# Only runs on merge commits to develop branch
if: github.event_name == 'workflow_dispatch' || 
    (github.event_name == 'push' && contains(github.event.head_commit.message, 'Merge pull request'))
```

### 2. Change Detection

The workflow compares the current commit with the previous one to detect migration file changes:

```bash
git diff --name-only $PREV_COMMIT HEAD -- supabase/migrations/
```

### 3. Safety Checks

- Verifies all required secrets are present
- Validates migration file structure
- Checks file readability and basic syntax

### 4. Deployment Process

```bash
supabase login --token ${{ secrets.SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN }}
supabase link --project-ref ${{ secrets.PRODUCTION_PROJECT_ID }}
supabase db push --password ${{ secrets.PRODUCTION_DB_PASSWORD }}
```

## Workflow Steps Breakdown

| Step | Purpose | Conditions |
|------|---------|------------|
| **Checkout** | Get repository code with full history | Always |
| **Setup Node.js** | Install Node.js and npm | Always |
| **Install Supabase CLI** | Get latest Supabase CLI | Always |
| **Verify Secrets** | Check required secrets exist | Always |
| **Check Changes** | Detect migration file changes | Always |
| **Skip if No Changes** | Exit early if no migrations changed | When no changes detected |
| **Authenticate** | Login to Supabase | Only with changes |
| **Link Project** | Connect to production project | Only with changes |
| **Validate Migrations** | Check migration file integrity | Only with changes |
| **Deploy Migrations** | Apply changes to production | Only with changes |
| **Verify Deployment** | Confirm migrations applied | Only with changes |
| **Report Summary** | Log deployment details | Only with changes |

## Expected Behavior

### Successful Deployment

```text
‚úÖ All required secrets are available
Migration file changes detected:
supabase/migrations/20250826120000_add_new_table.sql
üîê Authenticating with Supabase...
üîó Linking to production project...
üîç Validating migration files...
üöÄ Deploying migrations to production...
‚úÖ Migrations deployed successfully!
üéâ Migration deployment completed successfully!
```

### No Changes Detected

```text
No migration file changes detected
üîÑ No migration changes detected - skipping deployment
This is expected behavior when migrations haven't changed
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### 1. Missing Secrets

**Error**: `‚ùå SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN secret is missing`

**Solution**:

- Verify all three secrets are configured in GitHub repository settings
- Check secret names match exactly (case-sensitive)
- Ensure secrets have correct values from Supabase dashboard

#### 2. Authentication Failed

**Error**: `Failed to authenticate with Supabase`

**Solution**:

- Verify `SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN` is valid and not expired
- Check token has appropriate permissions
- Generate new access token from Supabase dashboard if needed

#### 3. Project Linking Failed

**Error**: `Failed to link to production project`

**Solution**:

- Verify `PRODUCTION_PROJECT_ID` is correct (find in Supabase project settings)
- Check `PRODUCTION_DB_PASSWORD` is the database password, not project password
- Ensure database is accessible and not paused

#### 4. Migration Syntax Errors

**Error**: Migration deployment fails during `supabase db push`

**Solution**:

- Review migration files for SQL syntax errors
- Test migrations locally first with `supabase migration up`
- Check for missing dependencies or conflicting changes

#### 5. Permission Issues

**Error**: `Permission denied` or `Access forbidden`

**Solution**:

- Verify Supabase access token has `write` permissions
- Check database password is correct
- Ensure project is accessible from GitHub Actions IP ranges

### Debug Steps

#### 1. Check Workflow Logs

1. Go to **Actions** tab in your GitHub repository
2. Click on the failed workflow run
3. Expand each step to see detailed logs
4. Look for specific error messages

#### 2. Manual Verification

Test the workflow steps manually:

```bash
# Install Supabase CLI
npm install -g supabase

# Login with your token
supabase login --token YOUR_TOKEN

# Link to production
supabase link --project-ref YOUR_PROJECT_ID

# Check migration status
supabase migration list

# Test migration deployment (be careful!)
supabase db push
```

#### 3. Validate Migration Files

```bash
# Check migration files locally
ls -la supabase/migrations/

# Validate SQL syntax
# Use your preferred SQL validator or IDE
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Testing Migrations

- Always test migrations locally before merging PRs
- Use `supabase migration up` to apply locally
- Verify schema changes work as expected

### 2. Migration Naming

- Follow Supabase's timestamp naming convention
- Use descriptive names: `20250826120000_add_user_preferences_table.sql`
- Keep migrations focused and atomic

### 3. Rollback Strategy

- Supabase doesn't support automatic rollbacks
- Create rollback migrations manually if needed
- Test rollback procedures in development

### 4. Monitoring

- Monitor workflow execution after each merge
- Check Supabase dashboard for applied migrations
- Verify application functionality after deployments

## Security Considerations

### 1. Secret Management

- Never commit secrets to version control
- Rotate secrets periodically
- Use least-privilege access tokens

### 2. Production Safety

- Workflow only runs on merge commits (not direct pushes)
- Validates migrations before applying
- Requires manual approval for workflow_dispatch triggers

### 3. Access Control

- Limit who can merge to develop branch
- Review migration changes carefully in PRs
- Use branch protection rules

## Manual Override

If the workflow fails and you need to deploy migrations manually:

```bash
# 1. Install Supabase CLI locally
npm install -g supabase

# 2. Login to Supabase
supabase login --token YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN

# 3. Link to production project
supabase link --project-ref YOUR_PROJECT_ID --password YOUR_DB_PASSWORD

# 4. Check current migration status
supabase migration list

# 5. Apply migrations
supabase db push --password YOUR_DB_PASSWORD
```
