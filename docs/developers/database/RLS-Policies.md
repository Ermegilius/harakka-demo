# Database RLS Policies

Row-Level Security (RLS) policies are applied across the database to enforce fine-grained access control. These policies ensure that data access is restricted based on user roles, organizations, and other contextual factors.

RLS policies are implemented through various migration files in the [supabase/migrations](../../../supabase/migrations/) folder. Key files include those for roles, user-organization roles, and storage items."

For detailed behavior and testing, refer to the Supabase instance configuration.
